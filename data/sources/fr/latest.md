## 2. Saber: An Efficient Sampling with Adaptive Acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking for Diffusion Language Model
- Domain: arxiv.org

- Summary: arXiv:2510.18165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However, the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation. Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks show that Saber

- Summary: arXiv:2604.13251v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Analog optical computers promise large efficiency gains for machine learning inference, yet no demonstration has moved beyond small-scale image benchmarks. We benchmark the analog optical computer (AOC) digital twin on mortgage approval classification from 5.84 million U.S. HMDA records and separate three sources of accuracy loss. On the original 19 features, the AOC reaches 94.6% balanced accuracy with 5,126 parameters (1,024 optical), compared with 97.9% for XGBoost; the 3.3 percentage-point gap narrows by only 0.5pp when the optical core is widened from 16 to 48 channels, suggesting an architectural rather than hardware limitation. Restricting all models to a shared 127-bit binary encoding drops every model to 89.4--89.6%, with an encoding cost of 8pp for digital models and 5pp for the AOC. Seven calibrated hardware non-idealities impose no measurable penalty. The three resulting layers of limitation (encoding, architecture, hardware fidelity) locate where accuracy is lost and what to improve next.

## 4. SHARe-KAN: Post-Training Vector Quantization for Cache-Resident KAN Inference

- Published: Thu, 16 Apr 2026 00:00:00 -0400
- Summary: arXiv:2512.15742v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Pre-trained Vision Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) store a dense B-spline grid on every edge, inflating prediction-head parameter counts by more than 140X relative to a comparable MLP and pushing inference into a memory-bound regime on edge accelerators. Standard magnitude pruning fails on these pre-trained models: zero-shot sparsity collapses accuracy, and restoring it requires an iterative fine-tuning loop that is impractical in deployment settings. We present SHARe-KAN, a post-training compiler that compresses spline coefficients via a Gain-Shape-Bias decomposition with a layer-shared codebook, paired with LUTHAM, an ExecuTorch runtime that maps the codebook into on-chip L2. On PASCAL VOC detection with a ResNet-50 backbone, SHARe-KAN Int8 reaches 9.3X storage compression over the Dense KAN baseline (6.32 MB vs. 58.67 MB prediction head) at a 2.0 point in-domain accuracy cost (80.22% vs. 82.22% mAP), with no retraining. Zero-shot transfer to COCO retains 88.9% of the Dense KAN mAP; most of this gap comes from the VQ clustering step itself, and further quantization from FP32 to Int8 costs only 1.3 retention points.

- Domain: arxiv.org

- Published: Thu, 16 Apr 2026 00:00:00 -0400
- Summary: arXiv:2604.13061v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes autonomous and interactive workflows, where reliability demands continuous, multi-turn coherence. However, current evaluation methods either rely on post-hoc semantic judges, measure unidirectional token confidence (e.g., perplexity), or require compute-intensive repeated sampling (e.g., semantic entropy). Because these techniques focus exclusively on the model's output distribution, they cannot monitor whether the underlying interaction remains structurally coupled in real time, leaving systems vulnerable to gradual, undetected degradation. Here we show that multi-turn interaction integrity can be continuously monitored using bi-predictability (P), a fundamental information theoretic measure computed directly from raw token frequency statistics. We introduce the Information Digital Twin (IDT), a lightweight architecture that estimates P across the context, response, next prompt loop without secondary inference or embeddings. Across 4,500 conversational turns between a student model and three frontier teacher models, the IDT detected injected disruptions with 100% s

- Summary: arXiv:2604.13071v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We introduce Earth Virtual Expert (EVE), the first open-source, end-to-end initiative for developing and deploying domain-specialized LLMs for Earth Intelligence. At its core is EVE-Instruct, a domain-adapted 24B model built on Mistral Small 3.2 and optimized for reasoning and question answering. On newly constructed Earth Observation and Earth Sciences benchmarks, it outperforms comparable models while preserving general capabilities. We release curated training corpora and the first systematic domain-specific evaluation benchmarks, covering MCQA, open-ended QA, and factuality. EVE further integrates RAG and a hallucination-detection pipeline into a production system deployed via API and GUI, supporting 350 pilot users so far. All models, datasets, and code are ready to be released under open licenses as contributions to our field at huggingface.co/eve-esa and github.com/eve-esa.

- Summary: arXiv:2604.13073v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generate fluent responses from interleaved text, image, audio, and video inputs. However, identifying which input sources support each generated statement remains an open challenge. Existing attribution methods are primarily designed for classification settings, fixed prediction targets, or single-modality architectures, and do not naturally extend to autoregressive, decoder-only models performing open-ended multimodal generation. We introduce OmniTrace, a lightweight and model-agnostic framework that formalizes attribution as a generation-time tracing problem over the causal decoding process. OmniTrace provides a unified protocol that converts arbitrary token-level signals such as attention weights or gradient-based scores into coherent span-level, cross-modal explanations during decoding. It traces each generated token to multimodal inputs, aggregates signals into semantically meaningful spans, and selects concise supporting sources through confidence-weighted and temporally coherent aggregation, without retraining or supervision.

## 8. From Relevance to Authority: Authority-aware Generative Retrieval in Web Search Engines
- Domain: arxiv.org

- Published: Thu, 16 Apr 2026 00:00:00 -0400
- Summary: arXiv:2604.13468v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Generative information retrieval (GenIR) formulates the retrieval process as a text-to-text generation task, leveraging the vast knowledge of large language models. However, existing works primarily optimize for relevance while often overlooking document trustworthiness. This is critical in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance, where relying solely on semantic relevance risks retrieving unreliable information. To address this, we propose an Authority-aware Generative Retriever (AuthGR), the first framework that incorporates authority into GenIR. AuthGR consists of three key components: (i) Multimodal Authority Scoring, which employs a vision-language model to quantify authority from textual and visual cues; (ii) a Three-stage Training Pipeline to progressively instill authority awareness into the retriever; and (iii) a Hybrid Ensemble Pipeline for robust deployment. Offline evaluations demonstrate that AuthGR successfully enhances both authority and accuracy, with our 3B model matching a 14B baseline. Crucially, large-scale online A/B tests and human evaluations conducted on the commercial web search platform confirm sign
